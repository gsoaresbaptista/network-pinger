# Network-Pinger

## About

A UDP client and server pinger to the computer engineering course of Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil.
This is a very simple implementation of a pinger, using UDP although ICMP is ideal for this type of application, once the main goal is learning.
The client can save all sent and received packet data to a csv file, while the server and the client can save the stdout output to a txt logger file. Default timeout is 10 seconds for both server and client.

## Running

Make sure you have ```Python 3.10.6``` or a more recent version and be in the root folder.

First, install all dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To run the server, do:

```python pinger/server_cli.py```

For the client, run:

```python pinger/client_cli.py```

Some parameters can be passed to  both cli, to see more about this add ```--help``` to the end of either command.


## Simulations

The server can simulate a few possible fauls, such as:
- Delayed response: Wait min 10ms and max 200ms to send the response
- Packet loss: Response packet is not sent to client with 25% chance

The client handles the failures simulated by the server, considering them when calculating the statistics. All simulations must be enabled if desired as they are disabled by default.

## Server Parameters

Some parameters can be passed to the server cli to change certain behaviors. Are they:
- ```-l``` or ```--logger```: The server saves all stdout output in the server_log.txt file.
- ```-t NUMBER``` or ```--timeout NUMBER```: The server stops after **NUMBER** seconds with no requests.
- ```-sd``` or ```--simulate_delay```: The server allows packet delay response simulation.
- ```-sl``` or ```--simulate_loss```: The server allows packet loss simulation.


An example to run a server cli with parameters is:

```python pinger/server_cli.py -t 2 -sd -sl```

Server running with a timeout of 2 seconds and simulating delay and loss.


## Client Parameters

The client can receive parameters below by command line:
- ```-l``` or ```--logger```: The client saves all stdout output in the client_log.txt file.
- ```-t NUMBER``` or ```--timeout NUMBER```: The client will consider the packet lost after waiting for **NUMBER** seconds.
- ```-c``` or ```--csv```: The client saves all sent and received packet data in the packets_data.csv file.

An example to run a client cli with parameters is:

```python pinger/client_cli.py --timeout 1 --csv```

## Example

Running the following commands in separate terminals:

```python pinger/server_cli.py -t 3 -sd -sl -l```

```python pinger/client_cli.py --timeout 1 --csv --logger```

We got the following output files:
